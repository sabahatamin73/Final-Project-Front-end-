        </div>  

<p class="info">
Travel is one of those things that naturally gives rise to queries, concerns and doubts, so we’re here to put your mind at ease. Which trip is right for me? What do I do about visas? How much do I tip? Should I have banh mi or pho for lunch? For questions frequent and otherwise, this is the spot.
</p>

 
<div id="accordion">
  <h3>How many people can join a tour?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>We keep our group sizes low so you have the freedom to move around and get involved with your surroundings, as well as more personal attention from our local guides. This intimate size ensures that your group will not crowd your experience. You can expect up to 15 travelers on a trip but the average is 10. Check individual trip pages for maximum group sizes.
    
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3> What clothing should I pack for one of your adventures?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   We always recommend packing as light as possible however the specific requirements for your tour will vary widely depending on where and when you are traveling. Our 'Trip Details' document includes a suggested packing list and these can be downloaded from each individual trip summary page. The checklist is tour specific and based upon the experience of our ground staff.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Can you help arrange my travel visas?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
  Requirements for travel visas vary widely depending on your nationality and your destination. Although we are unable to arrange visas on your behalf we have provided links on our “Resources” page to websites that will help you determine if visas are required. If you do require a visa you can arrange them yourself or use the services of a travel agent or visa processing company.
    </p>
    
  </div>
  <h3>What vaccinations are recommended for this adventure? </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
  It's important that you receive the most accurate and up-to-date travel health information for the region you will be visiting. The only one qualified to provide you with this advice is your family physician or a specialist from a Travel Health clinic. Our “Resources” page does provide links to a number of websites that contain excellent background information related to travel health issues. Nevertheless these websites are no substitute for a personal consultation with a qualified medical professional.
    </p>
    
  </div>
   <h3>Are airport transfers included?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
   Most of our adventures do not include airport transfers and so we recommend you arrange a taxi on arrival (this is the most economical and efficient way of getting you to your hotel). If you would prefer a pre-arranged transfer these are usually available at an additional cost - please contact us for more information. Some of our adventures, including our “Superior” "Comfort Class", "Independent" and "Family Adventures", include an arrival transfer (departure transfers can be locally arranged at additional cost from the finishing point hotel).
